# TOSI
This package provides a general framework of two directional simultaneous inference(TOSI) for high-dimensional  as well as the fixed dimensional models with manifest variable or latent variable structure, such as high-dimensional mean models, high-dimensional sparse regression models, and high-dimensional latent factor models.

Please see our new paper for model details:
